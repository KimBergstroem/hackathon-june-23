## User Experience (UX)

A group of unlikely coders with various abilities came together to produce a website dedicated to representing the LGBTQ+ community and bring awareness to others about the struggles encountered by the community throughout history and up to the current day.
The concept of the name Spectrumind developed from the idea of connecting mental wellness and the human brain and associating the light spectrum to a community defined by its rainbow colors.
Key information for the site
•	What does it mean to be a part of the LGBTQ+.
•	How can we support members of the LGBTQ+ community who suffer with feeling ostracized by society.
•	Where can we learn about the history and accomplishments of the community as well as important figures and icons.
•	What can we do to help people who struggle to understand their role in the community.
•	When do events happen throughout the year that promote awareness.

### Agile methodology

The Agile methodology was chosen for this project to ensure flexibility and responsiveness to changes that may arise during the development process. It is used Github and the Project Board to implement Agile practices. User stories were initially entered into the 'To Do' column on the Kanban board, which served as the project's backlog. As development progressed, user stories were moved into the 'In Progress' column. Once a user story was fully developed, it was moved to the 'Done' column. This process allowed for continuous development and testing, with the ability to pivot and make changes as needed. Overall, the use of Agile methodology and the Kanban board in Github was effective in keeping the work organized and on task, resulting in a successful project.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The color palette comprising FF5252 (red), E1BEE7 (pink), 114069 (navy blue), C2DFE8 (light blue), and BC5BBC (purple) was selected for the project "SpectrumInd" to represent LGBTQ pride for several reasons. Firstly, the color red (FF5252) is often associated with love, passion, and solidarity, reflecting the strong emotions and sense of unity within the LGBTQ community. The pink shade (E1BEE7) symbolizes inclusivity, tenderness, and understanding, promoting a welcoming atmosphere for diverse identities. Navy blue (114069) signifies strength and stability, highlighting the resilience and courage of LGBTQ individuals. Light blue (C2DFE8) represents serenity, tranquility, and harmony, underscoring the peaceful coexistence and acceptance of different sexual orientations and gender identities. Lastly, purple (BC5BBC) embodies creativity, pride, and diversity, reflecting the unique and vibrant spectrum of LGBTQ experiences. Together, this color palette embodies the values of the LGBTQ community and visually represents the pride and celebration of their identities within the "SpectrumInd" project.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts

Amatic and Josefin fonts are the main fonts used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Amatic and Josefin are clean fonts used frequently in programming, so they are both attractive and appropriate.

### Imagery

All images used on this project are free copyrights. They are used within the site has been chosen to showcase the LGBTQ+ community. The images are also used to add visual interest to the website and to help break up different sections of the page. Imagery is relevant to the content and mission of the website and is also appropriately sized and optimized for web use to ensure fast page loading times. 

### Wireframes

All of the mock up designs for the web app were created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), a popular design tool known for its versatility and collaborative features. During design stage was kept in mind the principles of UX (User Experience) and UI (User Interface) design throughout the process to ensure that designs are intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing. Additionally, the mock up designs are responsive and optimized for use on tablets and mobile devices, to provide a seamless experience across different screen sizes. Personally, I find it very helpful to create a mockup design rather than a wireframe when I began a project, it helps a lot with styling, colours, layout during development.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

* Next, scroll down to the Buildpack section, click `Add Buildpack` select python and click Save Changes.

## Set up Environment Variables
* In you IDE create a new env.py file in the top level directory.
* Add env.py to the .gitignore file.
* In env.py import the os library.
* In env.py add `os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]` = "Paste the link copied from Heroku DATABASE_URL".
* In env.py add `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Make up your own random secret key"`.
* In Heroku Settings tab Config Vars enter the same `SECRET_KEY` created in env.py by entering 'SECRET_KEY' in the box for 'KEY' and your randomly created secret key in the 'value' box.

## Setting up settings.py
* In your Django 'settings.py' file type:

 ```
 from pathlib import Path
 import os
 import dj_database_url

 if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
  import env
 ```
* Remove the default insecure secret key in settings.py and replace with the link to the secret key variable in Heroku by typing: `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get(SECRET_KEY)`
* Comment out the `DATABASES` section in settings.py and replace with:
```
DATABASES = {
  'default': 
  dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
  }`
```
* Create a Cloudinary account and from the 'Dashboard' in Cloudinary copy your url into the env.py file by typing: `os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://<insert-your-url>"`
* In Heroku, click Reveal Config Vars and add a new record with the `CLOUDINARY_URL`
* Add Cloudinary libraries to the installed apps section of settings.py file:
 ```
 'cloudinary_storage'
 'django.contrib.staticfiles''
 'cloudinary'
 ```
* Connect Cloudinary to the Django app in `settings.py`:
```
STATIC_URL = '/static'
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'STATIC')]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE =
'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
* Link file to the templates directory in Heroku 
* Place under the BASE_DIR: TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,
'templates')
```
* Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR. Place within the TEMPLATES array: `'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]`
* Add Heroku Hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS: 
```ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['<Heroku_app_name>.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']```
* Create Procfile at the top level of the file structure and insert the following:
    ``` web: gunicorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi ```

* Commit and push the code to the GitHub Repository.

## Heroku Deployment 
* Click Deploy tab in Heroku.
* Select Github as the deployment method.
* Confirm you want to connect to GitHub.
* Search for the repository name and click the connect button to link the heroku app with the Github repository. The box will confirm that heroku is connected to the repository.
* Scroll to the bottom of the deploy page and select the preferred deployment type.
* Click either Enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deployment when you push updates to Github or To manually deploy click the button 'Deploy Branch'. The default 'main' option in the dropdown menu should be selected in both cases. When the app is deployed a message 'Your app was successfully deployed' will be shown. Click 'view' to see the deployed app in the browser.

## Final Deployment

* When development is complete change the debug setting to: `DEBUG = False` in `settings.py` 
* In Heroku settings config vars change the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` value to 0
* Because DEBUG must be switched to True for development and False for production it is recommended that only manual deployment is used in Heroku. 
* To manually deploy click the button 'Deploy Branch'. The default 'main' option in the dropdown menu should be selected in both cases. When the app is deployed a message 'Your app was successfully deployed' will be shown. Click 'view' to see the deployed app in the browser.
